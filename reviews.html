                GitHub is a web based hosting service where we can upload any thing. It is used mostly by programmers and developers.
                To use GitHub we need to Sign up a GitHub account. We must create a repository to upload our work. A single repository can
                be accessed by various users. If changes are made, we will still be able to compare it with the previous version of the 
                same file.
